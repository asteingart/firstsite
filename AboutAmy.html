    <h2> <b><big> About Amy: </big></b> </h2>

        

        <p> Born and raised near Boston, Massachusetts, Amy was fortunate enough to begin traveling with her family at a young age. In college, she had the opportunity
            to live abroad for a year in T&uuml;bingen, Germany and has always loved learning about other countries, cultures and languages. Amy now works at a nonprofit
            that focuses on creating mentoring relationships for girls in Boston, but she still makes travel a priority whenever she can! This website showcases 
            some of Amy's more recent trips, highlighting her favorite places and offering tips for seeing the world on a budget. </p>
